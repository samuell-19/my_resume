    <h2>Shortly About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently working as an SEO Manager at SkyCity Online Casino. <br>
    I started with SEO in 2020 as an intern and slowly I started to develop different skills withing SEO in order to reach the position where I am now. <br>
    As most of the people, I also started with on-page SEO - writing blog posts for which I did the basics. Optimization of title tafs, meta descriptions, alt text etc. <br>
    As the time was going I was developing my skills thanks to people sharing their knowledge on LinkedIn, I joined a marketing course and landed my first full-time job as an SEO Expert in February 2022.<br>
    Here, I have learnt the most of the things I know today.</p>
